# Information Stealer (Educational Cybersecurity Project)

## Overview
This project is a **documentation-based cybersecurity study** that demonstrates how
information-stealing malware operates on Windows systems. The project focuses on
**understanding attack techniques**, not deploying or distributing malware.

The implementation discussed in this project simulates how attackers may extract
browser credentials, clipboard data, and system information, with the goal of
**raising awareness and improving defensive security practices**.

---

## Project Purpose
- Study common techniques used by information-stealing malware
- Understand how sensitive user data can be targeted
- Learn how defenders detect and prevent such attacks
- Analyze risks associated with credential theft and data leakage

---

## Key Components (Conceptual)

### 1. Browser Credential Extraction
- Explains how attackers target browser-stored passwords
- Demonstrates Chrome’s encryption model conceptually
- Highlights risks of locally stored credentials

### 2. Clipboard Data Capture
- Shows how clipboard contents may expose sensitive data
- Explains why clipboard monitoring is a common attack vector

### 3. System & Network Fingerprinting
- Describes how malware collects system identifiers
- Explains why attackers gather OS, IP, and hardware details
